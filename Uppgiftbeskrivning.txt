Bees are vital for our survival as honeybee pollination is vital for about 70% of all crops used for
food. Even if there are almost 100 million beehives worldwide which increases steadily each year,
the bee populations are dying. Some reasons are parasites, diseases, poor nutrition, or pesticides.
Some reasons are simply unknown. Beekeepers need both better tools & knowledge to increase the
survival rate of their bees. Which is one of the reasons we at Ericsson garage decided to start a
project with connected beehives some years ago. We now have beehives on the roof of our office
with various sensors to get data such as: climate, hive weight, sound & image.

ER3: Varroa (Parasites). Determine if the bee is carrying any parasites. Dependent on finding open
data sets. Open data sets with bees with varroa exists, but still to determine if useful. Machine
learning model for determining bees and bees carrying pollen on photos available for reference.
Det går bra att kommunicera på Svenska även om utmaningarna är beskrivna på engelska. Håkan har
data i form av annoterade bilder som han kan ge er.
